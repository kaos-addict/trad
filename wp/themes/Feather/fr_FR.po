"When you download one of my themes and unzip it you will see a few different folders. Photoshop Files, Plugins, Theme, and, with select themes, Fonts. The &quot;theme folder&quot; that you need to upload to your server is located within the Theme folder in your ZIP file. You need to upload this folder to the correct folder on your server (wp-content/themes/). Do not upload the &quot;Theme&quot; folder, only upload the folder within the &quot;Theme&quot; folder. For example, if you are using my Studioblue theme you would want to upload the &quot;StudioBlue&quot; folder contained within the &quot;Theme&quot; folder to wp-content/themes. Do not upload StudioBlue's parent folder. Furthermore, make sure that you do not rename the &quot;StudioBlue&quot; folder.\n"
